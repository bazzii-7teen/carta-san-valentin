            <p>
                I just wanted to say something honest.
               I know we broke, and things got hard, but even after everything, my feelings for you never changed. I still think about you, I still care, and yeah… I still love you.
              What we had was real, and it means too much to me to let it go without trying again. I’m not here to promise perfection — I just want us, choosing each other again.
               So this is me, from the heart, on Valentine’s Day…
               I love you. Will you come back to me and be my Valentine? ❤️🫶

                ¡Feliz San Valentín!
            </p>
